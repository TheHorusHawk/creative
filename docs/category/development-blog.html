</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>So, what have I been up to and why haven't I been posting anything.</p>
<p>Well, I've started a web development bootcamp, which has been exciting and has occupied my development time. It's been good to review some things, but also to learn a host of new ones, namely practical hands-on knowledge on some things I felt I knew but didn't have much actual experience of doing, namely in HTML and CSS. Things like page heros and how to make the website respond precisely how you want it to. It's been great to use Bootstrap again and to get deeper into the functionalities of that.</p>
<p>I have created a profile website that is now the base domain, the horushawk.github.io, this website being hosted on /creative.</p>
<p>As part of my work with the Bootcamp, I have been using a different static website generator, named 11ty, which I feel may be... better? Actually, I don't think it's better, better, it's just that it give you access to npm modules, which I've been using for some advanced Markdown features. Maybe not that advanced, but still pretty cool. Watch this space, as it changes.</p>
<p>So, who knows what I'll be doing from this point forward. The games arena project is sadly, on hold for the time being, as I haven't had time to go to it, though I'm still interested in developing it.</p>
<p>It's also been good to deal a lot with git and github. Again, not some "new" things I've learned, but the practice is actually really good, and a different thing from the knowledge. I suppose the distinction between tow types of knowledge is important here. I knew the "what" of most things git, but now I know "how" to do git at a much deeper level, and am much more comfortable running commands without copy-pasting them from somewhere else. And, as a milestone, I submitted a pull request for the first time. It was to correct an error in the pelican documentation, which turns out was not an error at all! So it was rejected. But it was oddly exhilirating.</p>
<p>Hope to be able to keep this up to date. I'm definitely doing loads on the dev front, and still have some book reviews in mind to do, as well as adding some features to this site, and expand the domain generally.</p>                </article>
