It's a book called "The Master and his Emisssary".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a very large book, great if you like covering all the bases, and really getting into the argument, which I found quite compelling. It lays out a model of how the brain functions, in which consciousness emerges from the interplay between two different, quasi-autonomous, counsciousnesses, which stem from the left and right brain. It does away with old theories of hemispheric differentiation (bicameral mind, anyone?) and sets out a new one, which can be summarised thusly: the between the hemispheres lies not so much in what is processed where, but rather in &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; it's processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, as we go on about our days, we have two kinds of processing happening, which can be broadly characterised as processing-as-prey and processing-as-predator. Suppose we are attempting to hunt. We are using a certain type of focused awareness, that zooms in on our objective. In order for it to work, this awareness cannot be simultaneously paying attention to the foliage around our prey, the pretty sundown, even individuals other than the prey we've selected, such as other gazelles. I'm sure we've all been so absorbed in a single-minded (great word for this situation) pursuit that we couldn't hear other people talking directly to us. That's an example of how this type of awareness filters out many inputs, if it is to function correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing, though. In a world in which we are always predator, that might work. But we are also prey. And if we've presently so manipulated our environment so as to almost never be faced with predators, there's still hazards around. So, another type of awareness has to be there constantly - or we die. It's our consciousness as prey. If we are so absorbed with the gazelle we're hunting that nothing can shake us out of it, a predator will be able to get right next to us, and gobble us up. Or we might fall into a ravine. So, in order for the hunt to work, we need to have this other consciousness, which is not focused at all, but rather is constantly scanning the environment for the slightest hint of an approaching lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if we do hear a roar, our consciousness will be snapped out of predator mode and into prey mode. If our objective was to find something to eat, it has now changed to not become something that's eaten. Notice this implies that the counsciousness-as-prey has priority, it is the one which must be listened to if there's a conflict, as we can always hunt later, if we're still alive, but if we're eaten even once, well, then we can't hunt anymore, can we? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For McGilchrist, this suggests that the master counsciousness, which has its seat on the right hemisphere, sets out these objectives (find food, build house, get firewood, find a job) for his emissary to take care of. And if at any point the master counsciousness decides the objective has changed, it is changed immediately, and the emissary, who sits on the left hemisphere, has to execute the new plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, when the emissary is going about the business of solving some narrowly defined problem, he must be left alone in order to function well. This may give it ideas, namely the idea that he is the only real consciousness, and he doesn't need the master at all. Such is, for McGilchrist, the state of our present culture. Any type of unfocused processing is frowned upon and left-hemispheric objectives rule the day. Hence, we have manipulated the world to rid ourselves from ever having to face a predator, or even hazards, as much as we can. The emissary, like a shady vizier, sees his dethronement with horror, and so individuals walk around doing what they can to never have to engage in any free-flowing thought which might create new ideas, objectives, and perhaps even re-generate the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emissary works through language. It's one of his main tools. Mental chatter keeps consciousness from defaulting back to the master. Meditation may help us finding the master again, and update our programming to account for the change in the environment. Perhaps we have endeavoured to be very productive a few generations ago because we lived in times of food scarcity, and that urgency has trickled down the generations via left-hemispheric capture into the present time, where the threat to our food security lies arguably more with excessive productivity (diminishing returns, environmental collapse, etc) than with lack of human productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if we took a moment to listen to the master, we would see it that way. If we don't do it voluntarily, it will have to be done for us, in the form of a crisis, personal or global. I feel there's a few of us who've sensed this already, and are sending signs to the culture to get away from our present mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of the book sets out a very high-level view of how McGilchrist believes the interplay between relative dominance of hemispheres has been recorded via art history. If I feel strongly that the first half is worth the read, though it may at times be a bit too dense for the causal read - not a criticism of the author, merely the suggestion that someone should write a more accessible version of the argument - this second half is too thin on the details and does that pursuit a disservice. It would have been better to ommit it altogether and perhaps do that work somewhere else, or suggest it be done by someone else. It even veers into the stereotypical, and perhaps even misunderstands the purpose of art as a vehicle for change, which is rarely to be found on statistical analysis but rather on contemplating the best examples. I may be too close to this subject, too critical of History of Art as a subject in and of itself, to serve as impartial judge (which I never claimed to be anyway) but suffice it to say that the second part is absolutely unnecessary to the arguments the book sets out and that one can be thoroughly persuaded by the first half while simultaneously rejecting the second. And since the book is about 600 pages long, if I remember correctly, knowing you may confidently read only half of it for a thorough understading of the argument will perhaps be greeted as good news by some of you. Perhaps even motivate a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do be aware that it is a quite technical book, with a particularly long chapter at the beginning which the author understands will act as a bit of a hurdle before the argument is laid out. Know that time is not wasted and is necessary for you to stand on good stead in following the really meaty part of the argument. However, as set out before, there is perhaps space for a less thorough, more accessible, version of the argument to be published for more general consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, maybe I should write that one myself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Updates on website</title><link href="https://thehorushawk.github.io/creative/updates-on-website.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-28T21:05:26+01:00</published><updated>2023-09-28T21:05:26+01:00</updated><author><name>Bruno Teles</name></author><id>tag:thehorushawk.github.io,2023-09-28:/creative/updates-on-website.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week I fiddled with my template a bit more.

It's been fun to get to understand better and better Pelican's functionalities. The biggest most visible change is that I've added a comments section using utterances, which uses github's issues. That's a simple and elegant solution that doesn't require me to add another provider like DISQUS. The only downside is that you need to have a Github account to leave comments, which I realise is not everyone. So, sorry if you want to leave a comment but don't have a Github account. I'd say leave a comment to let me know but, well, the moment you do that, then it's not a problem anymore is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made some other small changes, such as the pages' titles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Development Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Games Arena, Enter Vue</title><link href="https://thehorushawk.github.io/creative/games-arena-enter-vue.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-26T19:00:03+01:00</published><updated>2023-09-26T19:00:03+01:00</updated><author><name>Bruno Teles</name></author><id>tag:thehorushawk.github.io,2023-09-26:/creative/games-arena-enter-vue.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, this week, I finished implementing the feature of setting a player as online and not online via middleware and caching.

They way it's implemented, there's a list of all the player who are online - defined as having interacted with the application in the last 5 minutes - on the cache at all times, which is updated by the middleware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function that renders the template then works out who isn't online and feeds both lists to the template. The webpage then shows two lists, one with the players who are online and another with the players who are offline. Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for some frontend. I now need to implement a way for players to interact with other players and challenge them to games. I wanted to use Vue.js, a library, rather than vanilla Javascript, which I have no experience with. So, I've been reading documentation and doing tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what's next, I have to implement the interactions. I'll start by implementing a button next to the name of a player with something like "Challenge to game". I'm not 100% sure I'll be using Vue, but, if I do, I'll have to configure the application to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll let you know all about it on my next update!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Development Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Games Arena: New project first week update</title><link href="https://thehorushawk.github.io/creative/games-arena-new-project-first-week-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-14T17:09:47+01:00</published><updated>2023-09-14T17:09:47+01:00</updated><author><name>Bruno Teles</name></author><id>tag:thehorushawk.github.io,2023-09-14:/creative/games-arena-new-project-first-week-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Django web application, project name Games Arena, week one update.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm starting a new project in Django, which is to be the final project of my Web Development with Python and Javascript course. Unlike other projects of that course, this one I will be doing from scratch, with no seed code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first week, I have initialized the django project and created a screen to choose your nickname. Once you do, or if you already have logged in before, it will take you to the Games Arena proper, where you'll be able to see who else is online so you can choose people to play a game. All this is done via sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, being online is implemented only as a button which allows players to make themselves available for a game, but I'm looking to implement a way for the server to tell who is and isn't online automatically. I'm looking to do this via Redis. More news on that, or on my failure to do so, on my next update, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Development Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Games Arena: Update</title><link href="https://thehorushawk.github.io/creative/games-arena-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-14T17:09:47+01:00</published><updated>2023-09-14T17:09:47+01:00</updated><author><name>Bruno Teles</name></author><id>tag:thehorushawk.github.io,2023-09-14:/creative/games-arena-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know when you're going through something, and you realize you have to do something else before you do that, and you do that hoping it's not going to take long, and while you're doind that something else you bump into something else that you also have to investigate?

If you've ever read David Foster Wallace and got sucked into a footnote midsentence and realised that footnote is a massive text with its own footnotes, you know the feeling I'm describing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's how it's been going for me. This past week I have decided to implement a "is online" feature to check which of my players is online. So I decided to do it via cache, and that has led me to do a tutorial on caching with Redis, which is a cached database, and of course this tutorial was broken in newer versions of Python/Django, so I've decided to use a virtual environment just to do the tutorial, so that's got me to research into how virtual environments work and once I've got it to work (via a different workaround, as it turned out), I learned a cool node tool called loadtest, then  I realised I had to implement it as middleware, so I've been seeing how to do that. In the process I also learned a bit about the intricacies of how to implement many-to-many relationships in django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all-in-all, maybe three lines of code written per hour spent reading documentation. But that is not to say it's been a bad week, just one in which I got to go deeper and learn really important foundational elements for the work ahead, and future workings with the tools. It's been a great week, actually, and it's felt like I keep overcoming obstacles and getting more knowledge as a result. Hazzaa! It's weeks in which it seems I can't make headway, and I'm not learning anything, which I dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I've got a really nice and functional middleware. It doesn't do much, yet, that's for later, but I hope I'll be able to park this one item soon. I'm still on a single item on a spec: implement "is online". I will be phewing hard once that is done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Development Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Website: New project using Pelican</title><link href="https://thehorushawk.github.io/creative/website-new-project-using-pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-14T17:09:47+01:00</published><updated>2023-09-14T17:09:47+01:00</updated><author><name>Bruno Teles</name></author><id>tag:thehorushawk.github.io,2023-09-14:/creative/website-new-project-using-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;First update on new project, creating a website using Pelican&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm making a static website (this one) in which to keep the different parts of my internet presence organised, and also to help me figure out who am am? (Not not am, must not say am).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using Pelican, a Python static website generator, and Markdown for the pages. Pelican is very easy to use. Having written websites in clunkier ways (my previous website, which dates from the early 2000s, was written entirely on raw HTML) I found it a breeze to create the content, layout and articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is short and very well written, with about everything you might need from a website like this. It lends itself to being configured to automate lots of things (such as the article type, category, date of publication and modification) as well as automatically reacting to a new file and, making the output HTML and serving it. So, after just a few tweaks, you're just writing really simple markdown files and saving them. This is a way of working I appreciate, but I'm also reassured I can change the fields being written automatically by manually including them, which I have been making use of to create an archive of past projects based on when I first released them, rather than the date of creation of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I've initialized my project, configured it to do what I need it to do, been trying out different themes and different functionalities. I like the way there's a base configuration that gets changed based on a smaller, easily readable file (at least so far, as I haven't changed that many parameters) which sets out what you need for testing and that there's a further file with config for when you actually go ahead and publish it. So far, it reads well and works well. Haven't brought it live yet, though, as I want to flesh out the content a little better before I do that, so I'll put a note here detailing how that went&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been using virtualenv to create a virtual environment where I have installed pelican and markdown. This is something I plan to do going forward on other projects, as it is a much neater way to ensure you have what you need for a particular usecase without messing with other projects. I will be using that on the web app I'm developing as well, especially as I'll be working with a database (Redis) which I haven't used before, and I want to make sure I don't break things in the base configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Development Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Website project update</title><link href="https://thehorushawk.github.io/creative/website-project-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-14T17:09:47+01:00</published><updated>2023-09-14T17:09:47+01:00</updated><author><name>Bruno Teles</name></author><id>tag:thehorushawk.github.io,2023-09-14:/creative/website-project-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Second update on website using Pelican&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week the website went live (if you're reading this, something went right) on GitHub pages! It's nice and easy to get a website up and running via a repository. As I had already started the repository, git was refusing to merge but that was easily solved. Nice to use git, as always. Every time something doesn't go my way I understand what why it's acting in the way that it is and I can just focus on how to solve the problem, deepening my understanding as I go about doing it. Maybe it's just that it has really clear error messages - or that my use of it is basic enough that it doesn't get confusing - but it really helps with keeping the frustration at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the theme. I looked at different options for themes but didn't find anything that fit what I wanted, so I just rolled up my sleeves and started tweaking the base template to bring it closer to what I wanted. I was kind of dreading having to learn Jinja to do it, but it turns out it's very similar to the templating language Django uses (the imaginatively called Django Templating Language, or DTL) so it was a breeze to get it to do the five or six things I had big issues with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I may opt for a different theme in the future. I'm not totally happy with how it looks now. I may find a suitable theme, keep tweaking notmyidea, make a new one altogether or a combination of the above. We'll see. But I can live with what it looks like for now, so I can focus on just publishing articles and expanding the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That rolls quite nicely to the third point on my update: I also rewrote some of the stuff here. Have a look around and enjoy. Articles are now labeled and sorted with a date corresponding to their latest modification, or its creation, if there was no modification. So on the home page (click the title to get to it) all articles will be listed in order of newest to oldest, so anything towards the top is the newer stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be all if it weren't for the fact that I also changed the About Me page, which won't show up in the list of articles on the home page (being what Pelican refers to as a "page", which behaves a little differently from other content, but you don't have to worry about that). So, if you're interested in me (and why wouldn't you be?) and/or don't want to miss any changes, remember to also navigate there via the menu above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this has been taking up all of my development time, so there will be no updates on my Games Arena project this week. Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it for this week's update! Really happy to have a website up and running and learning Pelican/Jinja while I do it. It's nice to have a place to showcase my work and to direct people to.&lt;/p&gt;

They read very well, each lecture with a specific topic which it will cover but not dwell on, it being quite possible to read each lecture in one sitting, which I appreciate. It is also quite accessible to one without a psychoanalytical background, which is my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the only book by Jung which I've read, though I did get the desire to read more, and I finished it some years ago. I bring it up only to discuss a single point in it, which is one of the ones that stayed with me. It is similar to what I did with the Science and Sanity review, which is why I titled it "not a review". Perhaps I should come up with a name for this thing, of reflecting on books I stopped reading a long time ago. Perhaps an acronym, how does Robisralta sound like? I'll do a little Robisralta of Jung's Modern Man in Search of a Soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to stress this is not a representation of the book in question, only of my opinion to what I remember from the book. I'm purposefully not going back to the book and getting exact quotes or representing the arguments accurately. I'm interested in what has occupied my mind in relation to having read the book, not on whether the argument I remember the book making is accurately represented by my memory of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part in question relates to this idea that people who have non-modern views of the world (I hope he doesn't call him "savages" but he might well do, it's the term of the time, but if he does, it's clear he doesn't mean it disparagingly) might decide that if they trip just after leaving their house in the morning on a day they were to sign a contract, they might go back indoors and decide not to sign that contract altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of the type of action, and thought, that modern man would balk at. Modern man would say there is no relation between the two things and tripping as you leave the house is not a reason to decide to sign or not sign a contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our society, most people will either align with this modern view and dismiss this sequence of thoughts as unreasonable; or they will take the newage-ey view that it is a perfectly reasonable way of thinking and acting, with the act of tripping being interpreted perhaps as a message from a benevolent spirit cautioning him against making a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I found remarkable is the argument Jung makes (or that I remember him making, see above). Jung makes a good argument for how the action is wise without in any way relinquishing his modern world-view. He claims that one who trips has trusted a configuration of the world around him that was proved to be wrong (the position of a step, a rock, his own body weight,whatever made him trip). He thought he knew enough know about the world around him, gambled on his incomplete knowledge (for one cannot know fully, and the mere fact that he tripped is proof that his knowledge was lacking) by taking a step forward and lost that gamble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put simply, he is distracted. What else might he be missing? Is it not perfectly reasonable to say he is not in a fit state to sign a contract today, as he is very likely to miss something important? If you can't even succesfully navigate the outside of your house, which you do all the time, how can you be trusted to enter into a novel agreement with someone else, which maps a landscape magnitutes more complicated and worse known, the Future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that argument compelling, and try to be aware of when I'm myself distracted. I was reminded of this because I was on my way to a job interview and, while at an intersection, didn't, at first, notice an oncoming car. While I didn't return home to hide under my bed, I made sure to pay close attention to everything that was happening during the interview, being especially cautious with what I was saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is this why one can read the future in the tea leaves, in the flights of the birds or in the cards of the Tarot? I haven't quite made that argument, but if I was, I would say that is a possible end-point of the type of attention that is provoked by understanding we navigate the world by gambles of simplification and hence need to be on the lookout for signs that we are not our best selves, and act accordingly. I do think it a good idea to cultivate that kind of awareness and, if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; tell the future by reading tea leaves, then do let me know!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Science and Sanity (not a review)</title><link href="https://thehorushawk.github.io/creative/science-and-sanity-not-a-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-30T17:33:13+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-30T17:33:13+01:00</updated><author><name>Bruno Teles</name></author><id>tag:thehorushawk.github.io,2023-08-30:/creative/science-and-sanity-not-a-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not really a review of a very long and technical book I haven't finished, but which has influence the way I use language and hence how I think. Something I'd like to get back to someday.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've never finished Science and Sanity, by Alfred Korzbski. I've barely made it a third of the way through, actually, having read it as closely as I possibly could, given the constraints of my life at the time. I'd say I made a proper attempt at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and Sanity is an exposition of a system of thought, or a discipline, called General Semantics, which Korzybski founded. It's a massive book, and not an easy read, which uses language updates of his own making (such as a full stop to mean, roughly, etc.). Why he does this is explained in the book, and he has what he thinks is good reason for it. Since I have not even made it to the middle of the book, please read the below as characterizing what I understood of the book and the system rather than characterizing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things the book does is it sets a group of changes in language which Korzybski proposes will make English a more "sane" language, in his use of the term, is synonimous with having the same structure of the world around. That, for him, is the structure of the universe as set out by scientific enquiry. Hence the title "Sience and Sanity". His most famous change is to proscribe the use of the verb to be in its capacity as verb of identity (basically, always, unless it's an auxiliary verb). The reasoning behind this is that verbs define relationships between things, and there's no such thing as an identity relationship, or at least, science hasn't found one in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For William Burroughs, the adoption of this would lead to an end to war. I don't know if we can go that far, but I do recommend trying to rephrase any heated argument without recourse to the verb to be, and you'll feel immediately how much more difficult it is to draw battle lines and be upset. We generally fight for what something is, and, if we teach ourselves to refrain from thinking in those terms, we will be released from a profound burden - though we may have to acquire another burden, which, as the Spiderman would have it, is the responsibility that comes with power. A power to heal, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ideas are worth engaging with, I think, and experimenting with. Noam Chomsky, the famous linguist, said something to the effect of he read all of Korzybski and that it could all be summarised in the sentence "Be careful with what you say." Chomsky, of course, has read much more than me, understands the subject much better than me and meant his comments as a diss, I think. But what I would say is that what Korzbski has shown me is precisely that being careful with language is anything but trivial, and it can have profound, read world-changing, effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something to consider, I think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Do lots cry?</title><link href="https://thehorushawk.github.io/creative/do-lots-cry.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-27T09:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-08-27T18:19:22+01:00</updated><author><name>Bruno Teles</name></author><id>tag:thehorushawk.github.io,2023-08-27:/creative/do-lots-cry.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Book review of The Crying of Lot 49, by Thomas Pynchon&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spoilerish review of Thomas Pynchon's "The Crying of Lot 49". I wouldn't worry too much about spoilers here, but if you wnat to go without knowing absolutely anything, just go ahead and read it (spoiler for the review: I'm going to recommend it!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's funny. It's terrifying in a strange way, like a ghost story made believable. It is a virtuoso display of use of words, of the art of writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's framed essentially as a detective novel, though there are no detectives, but a lowly executor of a will whose attempt at sorting the dead person's estate uncovers a great conspiracy or perhaps not quite. The novel lives for, perhaps demonstrate, this quantum-like "the electron is here and not here until we observe ita and collapse the wave function", in that we're never quite sure the conspiracy being uncovered is in any way real, and not the product of a paranoid mind (whose paranoid mind, the dead man or the executor, is also up for grabs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also impossible not to mention the superb finale, though it would be too much to just explain it outright. Let us just say that, same as our main character uncovers the mystery, we uncover the mystery of the book title itself, a seemingly nonsensical sentence which we will, by the end, be assured not just of its meaning, but mainly, of its terrific importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though perhaps not my favourite of the three Pynchon's I have read ("Bleeding Edge" takes that spot), it's short, and it does things some things too well, too well (by which I mean no other book does it quite like that) that it's essential to give it go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no excuses! Get it now at your local library or wherever you get your books.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Living Compost</title><link href="https://thehorushawk.github.io/creative/living-compost.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-10T10:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-04-10T19:30:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Bruno Teles</name></author><id>tag:thehorushawk.github.io,2023-04-10:/creative/living-compost.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Short documentary I wrote and directed, about East Sussex's Compost Club&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Living Compost - a day with Compost Club is a short documentary about Compost Club, a social enterprise company collecting food waste around East Sussex and transforming it into high-quality compost. &lt;/p&gt;
