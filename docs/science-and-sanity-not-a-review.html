</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I've never finished Science and Sanity, by Alfred Korzbski. I've barely made it a third of the way through, actually, having read it as closely as I possibly could, given the constraints of my life at the time. I'd say I made a proper attempt at it.</p>
<p>Science and Sanity is an exposition of a system of thought, or a discipline, called General Semantics, which Korzybski founded. It's a massive book, and not an easy read (which Korzybski, in the introduction, recommends be read twice) which uses language updates of his own making (such as a full stop to mean, roughly, etc.). Why he does this is explained in the book. Since I have not even made it to the middle of the book, I should qualify all the statements below as characterizing what I understood of the rather than characterizing the system. I could add "as far as I can tell" to every sentence below, often a couple of times, but I'll inspire myself on the DRY principle and ask you to mentally append ", as far as I can tell" just before the full stop at the end of each sentence.</p>
<p>It sets about a sketch of a group of changes in language which Korzybski proposes will be more "sane" which, in his use of the term, is synonimous with having the same structure of the world around. His most famous change is to proscribe the use of the verb to be in its capacity as verb of identity (basically, always, unless it's an auxiliary verb). The reasoning behind this is that verbs define relationships between things, and there's no such thing as an identity relationship.</p>
<p>This is why I've redirected you here in my "about me" page. </p>
