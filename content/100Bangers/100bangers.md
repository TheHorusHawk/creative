Summary: 100 bagers of my life, in autobiographical order (Incomplete)


This started as a list of 100 songs that were the track I thought was the best ever, that I would listen to on repeat thinking, this song is the best song ever... until I tired of it. I present them in rough autobiographical order - by which I mean the order, in my life, when I was was so entranced by them. 

While some fit that bill entirely, some stand for not a particulary song I used to listen to on repeat, but to an album I was overtaken by. 

I also had to add the rule of one band/artist per entry. Otherwise more than half the list would be by two artists. 

Here's 100 songs, the songs of my life.
