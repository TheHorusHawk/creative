title: Top Books by ratio of brilliance to length
Summary: My favourite books, ranked by brilliance to length ratio

Here be some books I recommend. If you don't have a lot of time to read but don't want to compromise on brilliance (i.e. can't be bothered to spend a year in which your main occupation is reading the book - looking at you <i>Infinite Jest</i>),  then this is the list for you.

1. Thomas Pynchon - The crying of lot 49
1. Flann O'brien - At swim-two-birds
