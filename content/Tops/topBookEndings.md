title: Top Books by ending
Summary: My top books by ending. By ending I mean the actual final sentence or so.

My top books by ending. By ending I mean the actual final fragment, never more than a sentence, followed by the actual quote. 

Perhaps the least useful article in my website. If you have read the book, it might make you smirk in recognition, but, brilliant though these bits are, if you haven't read all the preceding pages then they will mean nothing to you. It should't, however, spoil any future readings of the the book.

Inclusion on this list is a recommendation, for sure.

 <!-- If your memory is especially piercing, are about to read the book or a combination of both, it might stick in your mind long enough for you to be able to anticipate, if not the ending, at least, something which will affect your reading of it. But then again anything that can be said about a book will affect your reading of it, including just recommending it, otherwise you wouldn't have the phenomenon, which happens to me (see some of my reviews) of perfectly acceptable books or films being a let down due to how much I felt they were hyped. Anyway, you have been warned. -->
