Title: Interactive Fiction

I wrote an interactive piece of writing, using a software called Twine. These things are generally called "Interactive Fiction" but I'm unsure whether that's a good description for what I have made. Since I don't have a better name for them, I'm going to be calling these texts that too.

I have only done one so far, though I hope to make more, here is a [link to it]({static}/IFs/IF.html).

[//]: # (Or play it within [a frame]({filename}/hidden/IF.md).)

It's in what you might call alpha stage, and I'm very happy to receive feedback. If you want to contribute to enlarging it, feel free to suggest an answer which is not listed so that I might consider expanding the text in that direction. (This sentence will make more sense after you've played around with it, I hope.) 

Enjoy!
