Title: About me

- I am... Am I? Don't think so. More information as to why I don't say "I am ..." can be found in [my reviw of Alfred Korzybski's Science and Sanity]({filename}/Reviews/sns.md). (The short version is that I'm suspicious of any form of identification. Basically "I am ..." is a bit of a nonsense phrase unless there's some context involved (someone at a restaurant saying "I am a vegetarian" is definitely not saying nonsense, but communicating relevant information), but perhaps saying "I am a poet, a dreamer, a lover" says very little other than that's how I'd prefer to be viewed by you. Wow, that was the *short* version?)

- So, having gotten that out of the way, here's a different formulation. I'd like to be referred to as Bruno and I'd further like you to think of me as a web developer and a storyteller.

- I develop web applications in Python and Javascript, using the Django framework. View my development blog for news on what I'm working on now.

- I tell stories in different media. I have told stories using game design, interactive fiction, installation and video. Check out the corresponding sections to learn more.
