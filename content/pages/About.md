Title: About me

- I am... Am I? Don't think so. More information as to why I don't say "I am ..." can be found in [my reviw of Alfred Korzybski's Science and Sanity]({filename}/Reviews/sns.md). (The short version is that I'm suspicious of any form of identification. Basically "I am ..." is a bit of a nonsense phrase and we pay a heavy price for using nonsense phrases, so, if we can do without it, we should.)

- So, having gotten that out of the way, here's a different formulation. I go by the name Bruno and I do different things.

- I do some web development. Check out my [development blog]({category}Development) for news on what I'm working on now.

- I express things in different media. Check out sections on [Animation]({filename}Animation.md), [Games]({filename}Games.md), [Interactive Fiction]({filename}IF.md) and [Videos]({category}Videos).

- I sometimes review things (books, mainly). Check out the [Reviews]({category}Reviews) section to see some of them,

- This website will contain things reflecting my interests. Do have a look round and enjoy!
