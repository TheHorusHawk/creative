Title: About me

- I am... Am I? Don't think so. More information as to why I don't say "I am ..." can be found in [my reviw of Alfred Korzybski's Science and Sanity]({filename}/Reviews/sns.md). (The short version is that I'm suspicious of any form of identification. Basically "I am ..." is a bit of a nonsense phrase and we pay a heavy price for using nonsense phrases, so, if we can do without it, we should.)

- So, having gotten that out of the way, here's a different formulation. I go by the name Bruno and I do web development and express things.

- I develop web applications in Python and Javascript, using the Django framework. View my development blog for news on what I'm working on now.

- I express things in different media. I have told stories using game design, interactive fiction and video. I also sometimes review things (books, mainly). Check out the corresponding sections to see my work.

- This website will contain things reflecting my interests. Please have a look round and enjoy!
