Title: Interactive

I wrote an interactive piece of writing, using a software called Twine. These things are generally called "Interactive Fictions". There's no gameplay element to it, you navigate it by choosing from a selection of possible responses.  

Have a crack at it if you're in the mood to read. It's called [Conversation]({static}/IFs/IF.html).

[//]: # (Or play it within [a frame]({filename}/hidden/IF.md).)

I have also made some more straightforward (but not very straightforward) games.

Here they are:

[Body Mutilation](https://brunomadteles.itch.io/body-mutilation). Made during the Global Game Jam.

[February Moon](https://brunomadteles.itch.io/february-moon)

[I Am Become Consciousness, Collapser of Waves](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/i-am-become-consciousness-collapser-waves).
And this one was made as a group, also during the Global Game Jam.
