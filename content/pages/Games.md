Title: Games

I wrote an interactive piece of writing, using a software called Twine. These things are generally called "Interactive Fictions". There's no actual gameplay element to it, but you navigate it by choosing from a selection of possible responses, hence "Interactive".  

Have a crack at it if you're in the mood to read. [Here it is.]({static}/IFs/IF.html)

I have also made some more straightforward (but not very straightforward) games. 

Here they are:

[Body Mutilation](https://brunomadteles.itch.io/body-mutilation). Made during the Global Game Jam.

[February Moon](https://brunomadteles.itch.io/february-moon). Not sure this one can be called a game either.

[I Am Become Consciousness, Collapser of Waves](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/i-am-become-consciousness-collapser-waves).
And this one was made as a group, also during the Global Game Jam.
