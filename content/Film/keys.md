Title: The Keys to the World
Summary: Mendoza's statement, lightly edited (he does go on and on)

Ariel trusted me with his full confession earlier this year. I decided to do some light editing for clarity. I believe it to be a very important document in the understanding of our world. We would do well to remember that, regardless of what one feels about what is being confessed, Ariel has given this testimony at great person peril.
